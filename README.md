# time-series-resampling
The program makes datetime: date_range with parameters frequency and period handy for anyone working with Pandas. Inspired by pandas Datetime documentation. 
I struggled with it at first but later understood it, so i thought doing a breakdown explanation will be helpful to the python and data science community. 
There is conversion of freq from 1H to 2H and 4H.
This will be more of help to data science beginners.
